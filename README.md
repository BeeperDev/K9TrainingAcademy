## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project showcases my front end developer skills along with UI/UX awareness. Having a beautiful, seemless, functional design on any device will make your company stand out on the web.

## Optimizations

I might want to add a testimonials section and feature enhancements that include more animations and interactivity.

## Lessons Learned:

This project ultilized several instances of flexible sections. Utilizing flexbox, grid, and having well defined selectors for elements made it easier to organize content on the page.
